{"id": "nq_validation_55", "question": "architectural elements forming rib vaults eg wells cathedral?", "answers": ["an armature of piped masonry", "barrel vaults", "two to three barrel vaults"], "llm_response": "Of course. The rib vault is a defining feature of Gothic architecture, and Wells Cathedral (c. 1175–1260) in England is a superb example of its early development.\n\nHere are the key architectural elements that form a rib vault, using Wells Cathedral as a reference:\n\n### **1. Primary Structural Ribs**\nThese are the main load-bearing arches of stone that define the vault's skeleton.\n*   **Transverse Ribs:** Arches that run perpendicular to the nave, dividing each bay.\n*   **Diagonal Ribs (or Cross Ribs):** The two main arches that cross diagonally from corner to corner of a bay, forming an 'X'. These carry the greatest load.\n\n### **2. Secondary (Tierceron) Ribs**\nA key feature of the **English Gothic** or **Decorated style**, pioneered at Wells. These are additional ribs that spring from the same point as the diagonal ribs but travel to intermediate points along the ridge rib.\n*   They create a complex, decorative \"web\" of stone, giving the vault a much denser, more linear look compared to the simpler French quadripartite vaults.\n\n### **3. Ridge Rib**\nAnother English innovation, first used extensively at Wells. This is a horizontal rib running along the crown (top) of the vault, from the center of one bay to the next. The tierceron ribs connect to it, helping to stabilize and organize the vault's geometry.\n\n### **4. Bosses**\nOrnate carved stone blocks placed at the intersections of all the ribs. At Wells, these are often elaborately decorated with foliage, faces, and narrative scenes, serving both a structural function (locking the ribs in place) and an artistic one.\n\n### **5. Supporting Elements (The \"Launching Points\")**\nThe entire rib vault structure depends on these:\n*   **Piers / Columns:** The vertical supports from which the ribs spring.\n*   **Corbels / Capitals:** The carved stone at the top of a pier or column from which the ribs emerge. At Wells, the piers are famous for their unique \"strainer arches\" in the crossing, which provide additional support to the central tower, indirectly stabilizing the vaulting system beneath.\n*   **Springing Points:** The specific spots on the corbel or capital where the ribs begin their curve.\n\n### **6. The Infill (Webbing or Severies)**\nThe relatively thin, lightweight panels of masonry (stone) that fill the spaces *between* the ribs. The ribs carry the weight down to the supports, allowing the webbing to be thinner.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Wells Cathedral is a Landmark for Rib Vaults:**\nWhile rib vaults originated in France, Wells Cathedral showcases the early English evolution:\n*   **Extensive Use of Tierceron Ribs:** It has one of the earliest and most complete schemes of tierceron vaulting in the choir and chapter house.\n*   **Introduction of the Ridge Rib:** This element brought a new linearity and complexity.\n*   **Integrated Design:** The vaulting is part of a cohesive Gothic system at Wells, which includes pointed arches, tall narrow lancet windows, and a strong emphasis on verticality, all working together to create a soaring, stone skeleton.\n\nIn summary, the rib vault at Wells Cathedral is not a simple ceiling but a **prefabricated stone skeleton** (the ribs) filled with lightweight panels, allowing for greater height and larger windows. Its specific combination of **diagonal, transverse, tierceron, and ridge ribs** represents a foundational moment in the development of the English Gothic style."}
