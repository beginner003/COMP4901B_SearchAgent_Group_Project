{"id": "nq_validation_6", "question": "love yourself by justin bieber is about who?", "answers": ["Rihanna"], "llm_response": "Justin Bieber's song \"Love Yourself\" is widely believed to be about his ex-girlfriend **Selena Gomez**, though there are some important nuances to this:\n\n**Primary Interpretation:**\n- The song is commonly interpreted as being about Selena Gomez, Bieber's most famous and long-term ex-girlfriend. Their on-again, off-again relationship from 2010-2018 was highly publicized, and the lyrics about a narcissistic ex-lover seem to fit their tumultuous relationship.\n\n**Important Context:**\n1. **Songwriting Credits**: The song was actually co-written by Ed Sheeran and Benny Blanco, not by Justin Bieber himself. Ed Sheeran originally wrote it for his own album \"Divide\" but gave it to Bieber instead.\n\n2. **Bieber's Personal Connection**: While Bieber didn't write the song, he has indicated that he connected with the lyrics personally and was thinking of someone specific when he recorded it. In interviews, he's said the song resonated with him because people could relate to having an ex who was self-absorbed.\n\n3. **Alternative Theories**: Some sources suggest the song might have been originally intended for Rihanna, as Ed Sheeran has mentioned that both \"Love Yourself\" and \"Shape of You\" were initially written with her in mind.\n\n4. **Lyrical Content**: The song's lyrics describe a kiss-off to a narcissistic ex-lover who thinks highly of themselves, with lines like \"My mama don't like you and she likes everyone\" and \"If you think that I'm still holding on to something, you should go and love yourself.\"\n\nWhile the song is most frequently associated with Selena Gomez in popular culture, the exact inspiration remains somewhat ambiguous since Bieber didn't write it himself, but he clearly connected with its message about moving on from a self-centered former partner."}

This content involved protagonist Carl Johnson engaging in simulated sexual intercourse with his girlfriends.\n\n2. **Gameplay Mechanics**: When enabled, after successfully dating a girlfriend and reaching a certain relationship percentage (typically 40-70%), players could access a mini-game where they controlled CJ's movements during a sexual encounter using button prompts.\n\n3. **Visual Content**: The mod revealed explicit content including:\n   - Nude character models (both male and female)\n   - Sexual animations\n   - Interactive elements controlled by player input\n\n## The Controversy and Impact:\n\nThe Hot Coffee mod created a massive controversy in 2005 for several reasons:\n\n1. **Rating Change**: Originally rated M (Mature) by the ESRB, the discovery of this hidden content led to the game being re-rated as AO (Adults Only), which many retailers refused to carry.\n\n2. **Political Backlash**: The controversy attracted attention from politicians including Senator Hillary Clinton, who called for Federal Trade Commission investigations and helped introduce legislation (the Family Entertainment Protection Act) to regulate video game content.\n\n3. **Legal and Financial Consequences**: \n   - Rockstar Games had to release a \"clean\" version of the game\n   - The company faced lawsuits and had to pay millions in settlements\n   - Stock prices for Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar's parent company) dropped significantly\n\n4. **Industry Impact**: The incident led to increased scrutiny of video game content and influenced how developers handle cut content in their games.\n\n## Technical Details:\n\n- The content was actually **disabled** in the retail version, not completely removed\n- Modders discovered that by changing a simple flag value from 0 to 1, they could reactivate the mini-game\n- Rockstar claimed the content was created by developers for testing purposes and was never intended for public release\n- The company later released patches to completely remove the code from the game\n\nThe Hot Coffee mod remains one of the most infamous incidents in video game history, highlighting issues around game ratings, hidden content, and the relationship between game developers and modding communities."}

{"id": "nq_validation_12", "question": "where did the last name wallace come from?", "answers": ["a Scottish surname"], "llm_response": "The surname **Wallace** has a rich and interesting origin that traces back to medieval Scotland. Here's what I found about its origins:\n\n## **Etymology and Meaning**\nThe name Wallace is derived from the **Anglo-Norman French word \"Waleis\"** (or \"Gualeis\"), which means **\"Welshman\"** or **\"foreigner.\"** This term originally referred to people from Wales or Celtic Britons. The name essentially meant \"the Welshman\" or \"the foreigner\" in the context of medieval Scotland.\n\n## **Historical Origins**\n1. **Scottish Roots**: The Wallace surname is primarily Scottish, first appearing in records in the **12th century** in the Ayrshire and Renfrewshire regions of southwest Scotland.\n\n2. **Welsh Connection**: The name was brought to Scotland by a family from the **Welsh Marches** (borderlands between England and Wales). These were likely Norman or Anglo-Norman families who had settled in Wales and then moved north to Scotland.\n\n3. **Latin Origins**: In Latin documents, the term \"Walensis\" was used to designate Welsh people. In Scotland, this evolved to refer to **Strathclyde Britons** (Celtic Britons who lived in what is now southern Scotland and northern England).\n\n## **Geographical Distribution**\nThe Wallace family originally held extensive lands in:\n- **Ayrshire** (particularly around Riccarton)\n- **Renfrewshire**\n- **Kyle** region\n\n## **Famous Bearers**\nThe most famous Wallace is undoubtedly **Sir William Wallace** (c. 1270–1305), the Scottish knight who became a leader in the Wars of Scottish Independence against England, immortalized in the film \"Braveheart.\"\n\n## **Variations**\nThe surname has several variations including:\n- Wallis\n- Wallice\n- Walace\n- Walais\n- Waleis\n\n## **Modern Distribution**\nToday, Wallace is a common surname in Scotland, England, Ireland, and countries with Scottish diaspora like the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nIn summary, the Wallace surname originated as an ethnic identifier meaning \"Welshman\" or \"foreigner\" in Norman French, was brought to Scotland by families from the Welsh borderlands in the 12th century, and became firmly established as a prominent Scottish surname, most famously associated with the national hero William Wallace."}

However, TQM evolved from the contributions of several quality management pioneers:\n\n## Primary Developer:\n- **Armand V. Feigenbaum** (1920-2014) - An American quality control expert who first introduced the term \"Total Quality Control\" in his 1951 book \"Quality Control: Principles, Practice, and Administration,\" which later evolved into Total Quality Management. He presented the concept at the first international conference on quality control in Tokyo in 1969.\n\n## Other Key Contributors:\n1. **W. Edwards Deming** (1900-1993) - Developed the Deming System of Profound Knowledge and his famous 14 Points for management, which became foundational to TQM philosophy.\n2. **Joseph M. Juran** (1904-2008) - Introduced the \"Juran Trilogy\" (quality planning, quality control, and quality improvement) and emphasized the managerial aspects of quality.\n3. **Kaoru Ishikawa** (1915-1989) - Developed quality circles and the Ishikawa (fishbone) diagram, promoting company-wide quality control in Japan.\n4. **Philip B. Crosby** (1926-2001) - Known for his \"Zero Defects\" concept and the idea that \"quality is free.\"\n\n## Development Timeline:\n- **1950s**: Feigenbaum coins the term and develops the concept of Total Quality Control\n- **1960s-1970s**: Japanese companies adopt and refine these concepts\n- **1980s**: TQM gains widespread recognition in Western countries\n- **1987**: The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award is established in the U.S., further promoting TQM principles\n\nFeigenbaum's original concept emphasized that quality should be managed throughout the entire organization, involving all departments and employees, rather than being limited to the production or quality control departments alone. This holistic approach became the foundation of what we now know as Total Quality Management."}

{"id": "nq_validation_55", "question": "architectural elements forming rib vaults eg wells cathedral?", "answers": ["an armature of piped masonry", "barrel vaults", "two to three barrel vaults"], "llm_response": "Based on my research, here are the key architectural elements that form rib vaults, with examples from Wells Cathedral:\n\n## **Core Structural Elements of Rib Vaults:**\n\n1. **Diagonal Ribs** – Primary structural ribs that cross diagonally from corner to corner of each bay, forming the basic framework.\n\n2. **Transverse Ribs** – Arches that run perpendicular to the nave, dividing bays and providing lateral support.\n\n3. **Wall Ribs** (or formerets) – Ribs that follow the curve of the wall, connecting to the transverse and diagonal ribs.\n\n4. **Ridge Ribs** – Horizontal ribs running along the apex (top) of the vault.\n\n## **Advanced/Decorative Elements (seen in later Gothic vaults like Wells):**\n\n5. **Tiercerons** – Secondary ribs that spring from the main supports and connect to the ridge rib, creating additional subdivisions. Wells Cathedral's Chapter House (completed 1306) features a spectacular **tierceron vault** where 32 ribs spring from a single central pillar.\n\n6. **Liernes** – Short decorative ribs that connect other ribs (like tiercerons or ridge ribs) without reaching the main supports, creating intricate geometric patterns.\n\n7. **Bosses** – Decorative stone blocks at the intersections of ribs, often carved with intricate designs. These serve both structural and ornamental purposes.\n\n## **Wells Cathedral Specific Features:**\n\n- The **Chapter House vault** is an octagonal tierceron vault with 32 ribs radiating from a central pillar\n- The cathedral showcases the evolution from simple quadripartite vaults (with just diagonal and transverse ribs) to complex lierne vaults with intricate rib patterns\n- Wells represents the English Gothic style where rib vaults became increasingly elaborate with tiercerons and liernes creating star-like patterns\n\nThese elements work together to create the skeletal framework that distributes weight efficiently, allowing for taller structures with larger windows—a hallmark of Gothic architecture."}

This is known as the \"Presentment Clause.\"\n\n### Key Constitutional Provisions:\n1. **Approval Process**: After a bill passes both the House of Representatives and the Senate, it must be presented to the President\n2. **Presidential Options**: The President can:\n   - **Approve/sign** the bill into law\n   - **Veto** the bill (return it to Congress with objections)\n   - Take **no action** (if Congress is in session, the bill becomes law after 10 days; if Congress adjourns, it's a \"pocket veto\")\n3. **Congressional Override**: Congress can override a presidential veto with a **two-thirds majority vote** in both chambers\n\n## **State Level (State Constitutions)**\n\n**State Governors** have similar veto powers under their respective state constitutions:\n\n1. **All 50 states** grant their governors the power to veto bills passed by the state legislature\n2. **Veto override requirements** vary by state (typically requiring a two-thirds or three-fifths majority in the legislature)\n3. **Additional veto powers** in some states include:\n   - **Line-item veto** (vetoing specific provisions of appropriation bills)\n   - **Amendatory veto** (returning bills with specific amendments)\n   - **Reduction veto** (reducing specific appropriations)\n\n## **Important Constitutional Principles:**\n\n1. **Separation of Powers**: The veto power creates a system of checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches\n2. **Presentment Requirement**: All legislation must be presented to the executive for approval or veto before becoming law\n3. **Legislative Veto Limitation**: The Supreme Court has ruled that \"legislative vetoes\" (where Congress reserves the right to override executive actions without presidential approval) are unconstitutional as they circumvent the presentment process\n\nThe veto power is a fundamental constitutional check that prevents any single branch of government from becoming too powerful, ensuring that legislation represents a consensus between the executive and legislative branches."}

The main immediate consequences included:\n\n1. **Sharp Decline in Output**: Most Eastern European countries experienced significant drops in GDP and industrial production, with some countries seeing output decline by as much as 50% in the early years of transition.\n\n2. **Rising Unemployment**: As state-owned enterprises were privatized or closed, unemployment soared from near-zero levels under communist systems to double-digit figures in many countries, reaching around 11% or higher in some nations by the early 1990s.\n\n3. **Soaring Prices and Inflation**: The removal of state subsidies and price controls led to rapid inflation, with some countries experiencing hyperinflation. For example, Hungary saw inflation of nearly 30% in 1990, with further price increases expected as more subsidies were eliminated.\n\n4. **Economic Instability**: The transition created massive uncertainty in legal systems, property rights, and economic institutions, which further hampered economic activity.\n\n5. **Uneven Effects Across Countries**: While all countries experienced initial difficulties, the severity varied significantly. Some countries like Poland implemented \"shock therapy\" reforms that led to particularly sharp initial declines but quicker recoveries, while others took more gradual approaches.\n\nThese negative initial effects were often described as a necessary \"transition recession\" that countries had to endure before the benefits of market economies could materialize. Most countries began to recover by the late 1990s, though the transition process continued for years, with some countries adapting more successfully than others."}

This treaty recognized American independence and transferred the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains from British to American control, making the proclamation's restrictions on colonial settlement irrelevant.\n\n**In Canada:** The proclamation has **never been formally repealed** and remains part of Canadian constitutional law. It continues to have legal significance, particularly regarding Indigenous land rights and treaty relationships. The Canadian Constitution Act of 1982 specifically recognizes and affirms existing Aboriginal and treaty rights, which includes those established by the Royal Proclamation.\n\n**Key points:**\n- The proclamation was issued on October 7, 1763\n- It established a boundary along the Appalachian Mountains beyond which colonists could not settle\n- In the U.S., it became obsolete after American independence\n- In Canada, it remains a foundational constitutional document\n\nSo the answer depends on whether you're asking about its application in the United States (ended 1783) or its status in Canada (still legally relevant today)."}

{"id": "nq_validation_92", "question": "describe the three phases of the normal blood clotting process?", "answers": ["blood coagulation", "vasoconstriction,"], "llm_response": "The normal blood clotting process, known as **hemostasis**, occurs in three sequential phases that work together to stop bleeding after an injury. Here are the three phases in detail:\n\n## **1. Vascular Phase (Vascular Spasm)**\n- **Immediate response**: Within seconds of injury, blood vessels constrict (vasoconstriction) to reduce blood flow to the injured area\n- **Purpose**: Minimizes blood loss immediately after injury\n- **Mechanism**: Smooth muscle in blood vessel walls contracts in response to:\n  - Direct injury to the vessel\n  - Chemicals released by damaged endothelial cells\n  - Reflex responses from pain receptors\n- **Duration**: This phase lasts for several minutes, providing time for the next phases to begin\n\n## **2. Platelet Phase (Platelet Plug Formation)**\n- **Timing**: Begins within 15-20 seconds after injury\n- **Process**:\n  1. Platelets adhere to exposed collagen fibers at the injury site\n  2. Platelets become activated and change shape, developing projections\n  3. Activated platelets release chemicals (ADP, thromboxane A2, serotonin) that attract more platelets\n  4. Platelets aggregate together to form a temporary \"platelet plug\"\n- **Purpose**: Creates a temporary seal that can stop minor bleeding\n- **Limitation**: The platelet plug is fragile and requires stabilization by the next phase\n\n## **3. Coagulation Phase (Blood Clotting)**\n- **Timing**: Begins 30 seconds to several minutes after injury\n- **Process**: A complex cascade of reactions involving clotting factors (proteins in blood plasma):\n  1. **Initiation**: Tissue factor (from damaged cells) activates the extrinsic pathway\n  2. **Amplification**: Platelet surfaces and other factors activate the intrinsic pathway\n  3. **Common pathway**: Both pathways converge to activate factor X\n  4. **Thrombin formation**: Prothrombin converts to thrombin\n  5. **Fibrin formation**: Fibrinogen converts to fibrin threads\n- **Result**: Fibrin threads form a mesh that traps blood cells, creating a stable blood clot\n- **Stabilization**: The clot retracts and becomes more compact over time\n\n## **Additional Important Notes:**\n- **Clotting factors**: There are 13 known clotting factors (numbered I-XIII) that work in sequence\n- **Two pathways**: The coagulation cascade can be initiated through either:\n  - **Extrinsic pathway** (tissue factor from damaged cells)\n  - **Intrinsic pathway** (factors within the blood itself)\n- **Fibrinolysis**: After healing occurs, the body dissolves the clot through another process called fibrinolysis\n\nThese three phases work seamlessly together to prevent excessive blood loss while maintaining blood flow to essential organs. The entire process typically takes 3-6 minutes to form a stable clot, though this can vary depending on the severity of the injury and individual factors."}

{"id": "nq_validation_94", "question": "what is the oldest street in the philippines?", "answers": ["Cebu City", "Colon Street"], "llm_response": "Based on my research, the question of the oldest street in the Philippines involves some historical debate. Here's what I found:\n\n## The Traditional Claim: Colon Street\n\n**Colon Street in Cebu City** has long been recognized as the oldest street in the Philippines. According to historical markers installed in 1961 and 1999, it was established in **1565** during the Spanish colonial period and is named after Cristóbal Colón (Christopher Columbus). It's often described as the oldest and shortest national road in the country.\n\n## The Controversy and Alternative Claims\n\nHowever, recent historical research suggests that **Colon Street might not actually be the oldest street**. Several historians and researchers have challenged this claim:\n\n1. **Magallanes Street in Cebu City** is considered by some historians to be older than Colon Street. This street was part of the original Spanish settlement established after Miguel López de Legazpi arrived in 1565.\n\n2. **Streets in Intramuros, Manila** also predate Colon Street. The walled city of Intramuros was established in 1571, and its original street grid was laid out at that time, making some of its streets potentially older than Colon Street.\n\n3. **Pre-colonial settlements** had existing pathways and roads that were later formalized by Spanish colonizers, complicating the definition of what constitutes a \"street.\"\n\n## Historical Context\n\nThe confusion arises from several factors:\n- Colon Street's claim to being the \"oldest\" gained traction in the early 1900s through promotional postcards\n- The street was part of the Parian district, which was established after the Spanish began the Galleon Trade\n- Historical documentation from the early Spanish period is incomplete\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile **Colon Street in Cebu City** has been traditionally recognized as the oldest street in the Philippines since 1565, historical evidence suggests that **Magallanes Street (also in Cebu)** and some streets in **Intramuros, Manila** may actually be older or contemporaneous. The title depends on how one defines \"street\" and what historical records are considered authoritative.\n\nFor practical purposes and popular recognition, Colon Street continues to hold the title, but historians increasingly question this claim based on more recent research into Spanish colonial records."}

Both bones are **long bones** that form the skeletal framework of the lower leg\n2. They are connected along their length by a fibrous membrane called the **interosseous membrane**\n3. The tibia is medial (inner side) while the fibula is lateral (outer side)\n4. The tibia is the second largest bone in the human body (after the femur)\n5. At the top, both bones articulate with the femur (thigh bone) at the knee joint\n6.
