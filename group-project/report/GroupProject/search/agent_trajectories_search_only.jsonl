Their on-again, off-again relationship from 2010-2018 was highly publicized, and the lyrics about a narcissistic ex-lover seem to fit their tumultuous relationship.\n\n**Important Context:**\n1. **Songwriting Credits**: The song was actually co-written by Ed Sheeran and Benny Blanco, not by Justin Bieber himself. Ed Sheeran originally wrote it for his own album \"Divide\" but gave it to Bieber instead.\n\n2. **Bieber's Personal Connection**: While Bieber didn't write the song, he has indicated that he connected with the lyrics personally and was thinking of someone specific when he recorded it. In interviews, he's said the song resonated with him because people could relate to having an ex who was self-absorbed.\n\n3. **Alternative Theories**: Some sources suggest the song might have been originally intended for Rihanna, as Ed Sheeran has mentioned that both \"Love Yourself\" and \"Shape of You\" were initially written with her in mind.\n\n4. **Lyrical Content**: The song's lyrics describe a kiss-off to a narcissistic ex-lover who thinks highly of themselves, with lines like \"My mama don't like you and she likes everyone\" and \"If you think that I'm still holding on to something, you should go and love yourself.\"\n\nWhile the song is most frequently associated with Selena Gomez in popular culture, the exact inspiration remains somewhat ambiguous since Bieber didn't write it himself, but he clearly connected with its message about moving on from a self-centered former partner.", "total_search_steps": 4}}

This content involved protagonist Carl Johnson engaging in simulated sexual intercourse with his girlfriends.\n\n2. **Gameplay Mechanics**: When enabled, after successfully dating a girlfriend and reaching a certain relationship percentage (typically 40-70%), players could access a mini-game where they controlled CJ's movements during a sexual encounter using button prompts.\n\n3. **Visual Content**: The mod revealed explicit content including:\n   - Nude character models (both male and female)\n   - Sexual animations\n   - Interactive elements controlled by player input\n\n## The Controversy and Impact:\n\nThe Hot Coffee mod created a massive controversy in 2005 for several reasons:\n\n1. **Rating Change**: Originally rated M (Mature) by the ESRB, the discovery of this hidden content led to the game being re-rated as AO (Adults Only), which many retailers refused to carry.\n\n2. **Political Backlash**: The controversy attracted attention from politicians including Senator Hillary Clinton, who called for Federal Trade Commission investigations and helped introduce legislation (the Family Entertainment Protection Act) to regulate video game content.\n\n3. **Legal and Financial Consequences**: \n   - Rockstar Games had to release a \"clean\" version of the game\n   - The company faced lawsuits and had to pay millions in settlements\n   - Stock prices for Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar's parent company) dropped significantly\n\n4. **Industry Impact**: The incident led to increased scrutiny of video game content and influenced how developers handle cut content in their games.\n\n## Technical Details:\n\n- The content was actually **disabled** in the retail version, not completely removed\n- Modders discovered that by changing a simple flag value from 0 to 1, they could reactivate the mini-game\n- Rockstar claimed the content was created by developers for testing purposes and was never intended for public release\n- The company later released patches to completely remove the code from the game\n\nThe Hot Coffee mod remains one of the most infamous incidents in video game history, highlighting issues around game ratings, hidden content, and the relationship between game developers and modding communities.", "total_search_steps": 3}}
